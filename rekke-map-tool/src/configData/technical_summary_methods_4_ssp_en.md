### SSP scenario estimation
For a future projection of regional climate conditions in Upper Franconia, we selected the corresponding grid cell of the previously selected GCM (see section 2.5). We decided on a simple method to estimate the future regional climate conditions in Upper Franconia using the BAYWRF data set (see section 2.4).
The grid of 7.5 km was used from the BAYWRF data set for the area of Upper Franconia. A monthly “correction factor” between the GCM and the Upper Franconian region from the BAYWRF dataset was calculated for each grid cell from the years 1990-2017 (common period of all datasets). This correction factor was used to adjust the GCM data in the future decades in the mid-21st century (2045-2054) and in the end-21st century (2085-2094). This procedure was done for 2 m air temperature for the two scenarios SSP1 2.6 and SSP5-8.5 separately. The results were four grids (two scenarios and two time periods) for Upper Franconia with a resolution of 7.5 km. We decided to use the 7.5 km resolution (instead of 1.5 km) to ensure maximum consistency with other data used in this study (see section 2.3: ERA5-Land; 10 km resolution).
