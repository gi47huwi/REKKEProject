## IV. Qualitative Data

As part of the "Qualitative Social Research" course, Bachelor students at FAU conducted guided interviews in various Bamberg districts (Bamberg Ost, Gaustadt, Gereuth and Haingbiet) in the summer semester of 2023. We placed particular emphasis on neighbourhoods that are vulnerable in the transformation to sustainability due to their social structure (see [*SOZIALSTRUKTURATLAS 2023*](https://www.stadt.bamberg.de/B%C3%BCrgerservice/%C3%84mter/Amt-f%C3%BCr-Inklusion/Sachgebiet-Sozialplanung/index.php?La=1&object=tx,3481.257.1&kat=&kuo=2&sub=0&NavID=2730.386&La=1)).

The following questions were asked in the interviews:
1. what is the definition of a feel-good place in Bamberg?
2. feel-good places and climate change: What threats, concerns and restrictions are mentioned?
3. climate change and action: what can be done? How committed are the respondents?

We categorised the identified feel-good places into three main categories:
- **Social meeting places:** This includes places or facilities that serve as platforms for social interaction and community activities. Further sub-categories are "Catering and retail", "Places of interest" and "Public places".
- Places close to nature:** These include green spaces such as forests, parks, meadows and gardens, but also areas with bodies of water such as rivers, streams, watercourses, canals, lakes or ponds.
- Exercise and sport:** This includes facilities where sport can be practised, as well as cycle paths and footpaths.

Certain locations can also be assigned to several categories at the same time.
For the subsequent geovisualisation, corresponding queries were created using the Overpass Turbo API ([OPENSTREETMAP 2023](https://overpass-turbo.eu/)). For the respective activities in the three main categories, the corresponding geodata serve as the basis for the visualisation of the resilience spaces.

The risk map also shows various cultural landscape elements based on the classification of *BÃœTTNER 2004*. The geodata was initially derived from the printed publication by retro-digitisation.
We summarised the cultural landscape elements into three main categories relevant to individual resilience areas:
- **Historically significant areas:** This headline item consists of the cultural landscape elements "Historic landforms", "Historic cultural landforms" and "Associative significance".
- Landscape features:** This includes the cultural landscape elements "Meadow irrigation", "Pastures", "Forest", "Orchards", "Hedges" and "Vineyards".
- Monuments:** Cultural landscape features in this category are "Existing ground monument", "Expected ground monument" and "Natural monuments".
