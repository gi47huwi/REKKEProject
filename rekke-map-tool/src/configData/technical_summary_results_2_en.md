### Temporal NDVI extrapolation
Future NDVI values are created for the periods 2045-54 and 2085-94 and the SSP1 and SSP5 emission scenarios. We further assume three different magnitudes of heatwave occurrences (section 3.5) which refer to the NDVI change estimated based on the mean and maximum number of heatwaves per decade of every pixel, respectively. Changes in NDVI are calculated for each pixel as relative difference (%) between the respective future decade (2045-54 / 2085-94), emission scenario (SSP1 / SSP5) as well as assumed number of heatwaves (mean / maximum per decade) and the observed mean NDVI of 2016-2022. The resulting deviations in NDVI are summarized in Figure 4 & 6 for the mean and maximum number of heatwaves per decade, respectively. Data voids in the NDVI maps due to vegetated areas with changes in land usage have been interpolated following the approach outlined in section 3.6.
