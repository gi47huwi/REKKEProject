###	Estimation of present heatwave frequency
Spatially resolved temperature values of Upper Franconia are retrieved from ERA5-Land climate reanalysis data. We use the daily aggregated data of air temperature at 2m above the land surface (Muñoz Sabater, 2019) as provided by the Earth Engine Data Catalog (Gorelick et al., 2017), covering a 30 year period from 1993 to 2022. To estimate events of drought stress due to consecutive days with unusually high daily temperatures (“heatwaves”), we use a specific temperature threshold for each day of the year. Thereby, hot days are defined as days with a daily mean temperature which is higher than the 95% percentile of all observed mean temperatures of the respective day throughout the 30 years reference period. Subsequently, the annual number of heatwave events is classified as at least three consecutive hot days (BayernAtlas, 2023). Since vegetation growth varies during the year, the annual number of heatwaves is restricted to the approximate Central European vegetation period between March 1st and September 30th. The estimated heat threshold for each day of the year is shown in Fig.1.
